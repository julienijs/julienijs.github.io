        <h2>The predictability of language change</h2>
        <p>It is most likely impossible to foresee when and where a particular language change will emerge (actuation problem), but the propagation of a language change is not haphazard. Rather, it follows an S-cure through time, that is best modelled by the logistisc equation. We can conclude that a change is real when the residuals of the logistic curve (the difference between the observed and predicted values) are small. In this project we take a closer look at these residuals and ask the following questions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Are S-curves robust enough to be used for prediction and forecasting?</li>
          <li>Which variables will make the (standardized) residuals larger in the positive or negative direction in case of an ongoing change?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In order to answer these questions we have build different models for 15 known binary language changes (new vs old variant), with the change (new or old variant) as the dependent variable and the decade (total of 15 decades) as the independent variable. For each change there are four models: one with all the data and three other models, each with some part of the data left out (first 5 decades, middle 5 decades or last 5 decades) to create a sliding window effect. We compare the residuals of these 3 partly blinded models to the residuals of the model with all the data to see how well the blind models are able to predict the missing decades.</p>
