        <h2>The predictability of language change</h2>
        <p>It is most likely impossible to foresee when and where a particular language change will emerge (actuation problem), but the propagation of a language change is not haphazard. Rather, it follows an S-cure through time, that is best modelled by the logistisc equation. We can conclude that a change is real when the residuals of the logistic curve (the difference between the observed and predicted values) are small. In this project we take a closer look at these residuals and ask the following questions:</p>
